Flat Dreams

Why should everything on earth have a price-tag attached to it? It kills Art in a true sense-of-the-term. 
It kills the spirit of sharing. Because those who cannot afford that price-tag will never get to see your 
art-form. Be it digital or otherwise.

The feeling of creating a painting and sharing it with the rest of the world is simply price-less. 
Something that master-card cannot buy.

What are Flat Dreams?

Flat Dreams is a range of fully customizable, fully-featured, free-to-use, royalty-free, Source-Code, Exploit-Code, Web-Template, Open-Document Presentation template and much more.

It was my flat-dream. 
Now itâ€™s yours.

For at-least the time-being, I am keeping it as "free as in Beer".
So, Enjoy ;-)
